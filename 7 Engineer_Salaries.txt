Does education affect salary?
    - If you are applying to a non-"FAANG" company;
    then yes it does.
    - If you are applying to only "FAANG" companies;
    then no it does not 
    - FAANG companies do not care about your education
    they care about the following:
        - if you are entry/junior:
            LeetCode
        - if you mid/senior:
            Experience
    - If you are going for a machine learning job,
    then absolutely a degree is important and needed
tl;dr:
    It is situational

Should you grind promotions at one company, or hop ever 1-2 years?
    - What pays more? A promotion or a jump?
    - A jump can be a promotion at the same.
    - It really matters on the company/team that you work for
    - Some people proritize money over work env, some are vice versa
    - if you only care about money and not so much the product;
        then yes job hoping is the answer
    - if you actually care and are passionate about the company
    and product, it might be worth it to stay and get a promotion
    because you will have more influence on said product
    - more pay toxic env OR less pay amazing env
    - you dont want to hop more than once a year, it looks bad if chained
    for 4+ years
    - tl;dr it always depends on what you value

What is the salary breakdown?
        - RSU, Base, Bonus, +++++
    - Base Salary
    - Stock
    - Bonus
    
    Base salary is what you will no external factors - guaranteed pay
    Bonus- is added ontop of your salary - also guaranteed but temporary
    Stock - this is value in stock options that are influenced by external
    factors and time
    
    When getting offers, you need to know which of these three do you 
    value the most? Pick the two most important

    Example, a company offers a high salary and high bonus,
    but the stock options are low and have a longer vesting period
    
    vesting periods can suck, some take 2-4 years to fully vest
    (aka golden handcufss)
    
    Example situation:
        Offer A:    
            Base: 150k
            Bonus: 25k
            Stock: 100k/yr

        Offer B:
            Base: 125k
            Bonus: 75k
            Stock: 75k/ yr
            
    Make sure you know which 2 you prioritize the most


Do side projects affect your salary?
- A few things to consider:
    - What level are you aiming for
    - what is the side project?
- At senior level positions, side projects do not matter
- At senior level positions they care about your experience
and if it matches the role they need

- At entry level, side projects can be great conversation points
for on sight interviews which can determine an offer

- if your side project is actually substantial (aka it 6k stars on GH, generating revenue,
its a big deal) then even the senior roles will look at that


How to make sure you are not being screwed over?
- Do you feel screwed over?
    This means that do you feel for the amount of work you are doing, the type of work 
    you are doing, your compensation is fair

- If yes, then what I would is look at the break of your compensation:
    - aka base, bonus and stock

- alot of the time, some companies stock drastically falls, which cause T.C to fall
- Is check the market via:
    - levels.fyi
    - glassdoor
    - linkedin salaries
- Always negotiate your first offer and make sure that the work you are doing is worth it

Example Situation:
    Situation A:
        T.C 300k - but you work 60hours /week
    
    Situation B:
         T.C 200k - but you work 35 hours/week

Example Situation II:
    Situation A:
        T.C 400k - but you work 50 hours/week
    
    Situation B:
        T.C 250k - but you work 35 hours/week
