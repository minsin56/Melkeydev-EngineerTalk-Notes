What about other strong companies(tesla, cloud kitchen)
- All because the company doesnt 'fit' in the acronym,
does not mean its worse by any means
- Sometimes, it has better benefits and even pays more
- Other companies may include but are not limited to:
    - Tesla
    - Cloud Kitchen
    - Coinbase
    - Discord
    - Cloudflare
    - NVIDIA
    - AND many many many more
Situation:
- You are applying to companies. You have done a few interviews.
You got an offer from NVIDIA, but are wait to hear back from
Apple. Nvidia is offering you equal salary, and the manager is super
excited to have you on the team for you to grow and learn. While Apple,
is kind of just filling in new positions and there is no individual plan for you
- The cloud for FAANG is real

Do you need to go to uni/school to get into these companies?
- No.
- These companies dont give a shit about a degree or not a degree
- What they do care:
    - Can you program?

How hard is the interview process?
- How hard is it really to get into these companies?
- First, you need a good resume, you need to get selected,
and then pass the recruiter screen

- Youre going to solve LeetCode problems
    - This is why the question of how hard a problem
      is not a straight forward answer
- on a leetcode level medium - hard for sure
- Data structures and algos

- The system Design question can also be hard:
    - Design a recommendation system
    - Design a scale subscription service
    - Where can you pin point a bottleneck/throttle?

What is the interview process?
- Here is the typical flow from zero to hired at a FAANG/MAANG
    - Application/Referral (this gets you in the door)
    - Recruiter screening (they call you and talk)
    - 1st Tech: You get sent a problem OR live 
        (technical only)
    - On-site:
        - A full day/ or days of interviewing
            - Multiple rounds of technial
            - Can be LCode or System Design
            - Behavioural interviews 
            - Multiple rounds of interviews with diff people
    - If you get passed all of this:
        - Get the offer and negotiate

Why do people quit/leave?
- We just talked about how great these companies are
    -We saw the salaries... so why leave?
- Money != happiness *
** I would rather be depressed and rich, than
depressed and poor

- Work life balance burnout
- Your stocks vested (golden handcuffs are released)
- You have learned how to be a good, strong engineer
and you just want to work somewhere else

- Better offer from another company 
- New companies coming out, may have more potential for innovation
than these existing giants
- You can only stay on top for so long

Is the money really worth it?
- Situation:
    - I was a broke masters student.
    i was making 700 a month from T.A and another 200-400 from Streaming
    - I wanted to work at a FAANG company since the beginning.
    - When I got my first offer from a FAANG company, it literally
    blew my mind

- if you come from a tough financial background, the money is life changing
- but that 'high' doesnt last forever.
- You will notice that you will still have the same problems you had before
- tl;dr - The money can change your trajectory, but you are always in control of the ship


How many months in advance should you prep for the interview?
- If you already have DS/A Average experience;
    - A month to two months is all you need of quality LeetCode
- If you are advanced at DS/A;
    - probably a week or two of quality LeetCode
- If you have absolutely no experience with DS/A;
    - 3-6 + months is probably what you need

What are the best ways of applying?
- First of all, before even applying, you need to have a
properly created resume
- ^ this could be a whole stream on itself, but typically:
    - you want to highlight the language and tech you used
    - Be efficient, use bullet points, and dont have run-on sentences
    - Be straight to the point of what you built and how
    - Try keeping it to one page (dont be afraid of cutting past experience)
    - Just make it look really nice
- What you want to do is:
    - Apply on the website 
        - This process sucks
        - You have to repeat what you already wrote, make an account
    - Use LinkedIn:
        - Nugget Method:
            - You search the company
            - Find recruiters/HR/Hiring managers
            - Send a ping, a quick message.
            - 'Nugg' them for a reply after
            - Email em using:
                https://hunter.io/ 
            - Set up 'coffee chats' with people to get referrals
    - Get 'cheap' referrals:
            - Blind community
            - just ask people

- How do I get my foot in the door with zero to no experience?
    - You want to get as much experience working on USED
    personal projects*
    * = any personal project is good!
    - BUT, a personal project, that is used by others, is even better
    - You contribute to open source code!!!
    - Dont be afraid to exaggerate a little bit
    - Any sort of work done on group/team projects/apps is great!

Applying from a diff country
- One advantage of these massive companies,
is there they do hire around the world/globally
- Its not just in the U.S
- I live in Canada
- A lot of these companies, have an entire division
for Asia, Europe and other countries.
- Salary will be adjusted to reflect where you live
    - Example, L5 at Netflix makes 300k
    in Eu, it will be adjusted
- Definitely possible!!

Tech stack unknown, but know others
- When you join a company they will have their way
of doing things
- From FE Frameworks (react, vue, svelt etc..)
- From cloud provider (aws, azure, gcp etc..)
- deployment and ci/cd stack (jenkins, make files, gh actions etc
- Interviews will sometimes ask you about a specific piece of tech
(AWS experience)
- ^ They could be using services from AWS you have never heard of
(KDA, different instances wtv wtv)
- You will more than like need time to learn
- One trick:
    - After getting hired, and you have some time before you start,
    email the team lead and ask what tech you should be familiar with
    - Start the Google/YouTube journey on that piece of tech
    - Allows you to get some experience and understand what it is,
    and terminology associated
    - No reading beats hands on experience
