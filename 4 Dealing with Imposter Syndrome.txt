What is imposter syndrome ?
 - It is doubting your abilities and skills, essentially feeling like a fraud in whatever it is you're doing.
 - In programming, it is very relevant to have this experience, or to feel like you're "not good enough"
 - Reasons when we feel imposter syndrome:
  - When you cant get a task/ticket done
  - When you feel like you'rew asking a lot of questions
  - When you feel like you just cant deliver on a task/goal
  - When you have a bad day
  - Occurs when you begin comparing yourself to others
  - When you're new to a topic/programming language/technology
  - Example: You just joined a new team where they use a lot of GCP (Google Cloud Platform). But you yourself
             only have limited experience/ exposure with GCP. There's a lot to learn, theres so many
             new terminologies that you feel overwhelmed and that you just cant piece it together
  - Feeling like you just aren't at the standard that you should be for your role
  - I think this is more common in engineers who are self-taught and perhaps did not go to school
    or have any internships previously
  - Is imposter syndrome simply you not understand or undermining your own abilities?
  - Others have better tactics of dealing with it than others
  - When I worked at a smaller company, and then I went to Twitch, i felt imposter syndrome
   - I felt like since the quality and standard at Twitch was higher, 
     I felt like i did not belong
 
Why do we even feel imposter syndrome?
  - The difficulty to accept your own skills and accomplishments
  - Feeling like you are not good enough also manifests itself into
    imposter syndrome
  - When you get into this negative mentality, you typically 
    stop seeing and realising all the good things that you are doing and 
    only focus on the bad things that are happening
  - Thinking you dont deserve something (the role that youre at?)
  - Example:
      - You just got hired as a new developer on a Google team
      - Passing the interview, getting hired acts as proof that you are 
        qualified enough. But: when you start, you feel overwhelmed, 
        and you start to question your own abilities in this team, and thus
        you feel like a fraud
  - Example:
    - you just delivered a project/service. You did it on time, and its great for launch.
    - However, you still doubt your code, the quality, the architecture, etc etc.

  - We lack confidence in ourselves
  - We compare ourselves to others injustifiably
  - We are too hard on ourselves
  - Sometimes you dont realize you're way better than you think
  - Experts refusing to be experts
  - We dont want to admit our accomplishments

What triggers imposter syndrome:
- After getting hired/ seeing the the new team and the current skill levels of my
new colleagues
- Too much thinking and planning 
- After getting a promotion 
- Making progress on a task
- Getting feedback
- Asking for help on a problem
- Seeing colleagues work/solutions
- New team terminology and tech stack **
- Dealing with new technology 
- Getting turned down after thinking you have improved

When you see your new colleagues, they have specific experience.
They more than likely, built the tech stack that you are going to be using.
They more than likely, have been using that tech stack for months - years+

- Imposter Syndrome poison: specific acronyms, jargon
- ** False flags for imposter syndrome: It doesnt even give you a chance

Why do we compare ourselves with other engineers?
- I think its human nature that we compare ourselves to others
- Because other engineers are better than us (?)
- It is a way for us to gauge where our skill set is 
- story time:
    - Remember the Twitch leaks?
    - i was very upset, and I was upset at people who I knew who were 
      looking at these leaks (my friends)
    - For programmers, one of the ways to get better at programming is 
      to literally look at other engineers code
- We do it because we want to be better
- We want to be better because we are always looking to challenge ourselves, improve 
  and progress
- Move up the ladder
- We look up at certain people/engineers that we deem are better than us
OR 
- We know this engineer built the product/service we are working 


At what point do we get over imposter syndrome?
- Never
- I feel the more senior you get, the more you feel this
- Its every time you get out of your comfort zone/
  given more responsibility/ more expectations
- Socrates: "The only thing that I know is that I dont know anything"
- Learn to manage it as oppose to sweeping under the rug
- It can be healthy, it can be powerful, as long as it doesnt take
  over you or diminishes your and your work.
- I feel the main thing you need to do with Imposter Syndrome, is:
    A) realise when its happening
    B) Take a step back, and before it manifests itself
    look at all your achievements and accomplishments
    C) Its a signal, that you feel challenged and an opportunity to grow
- No one expects you to know everythin

How a healthy/balanced lifestyle helps with Imposter Syndrome:
- You MUST have a balanced lifestyle
- Aim and strive to live healthy and appreciate life
- Physical exercise, hydration, sleep, and just being happy
will do wonders for you
- a healthy/balanced lifestyle helps with everything
- if you feel more and more pressure from imposter syndrome, 
i definitely recommend to go exercise, or AT LEAST, take a break,
go outside for a walk
- Example:
    Youre at your desk, and your code is just NOT working.
    And your colleague is able to do their things very quickly.
    This might trigger Imposter syndrome At this point, just stand up, close/sleep
    your computer go outside for 15 minutes.
- The quality of your work, matters exponentially more than the quantity.
- The worst you want to do, is release code and have a senior completely re-write

How to deal with negativity and naysayers
- feedback != negativity 
- "A lion does not lose sleep over the opinions of sheep"
- Usually, if someone disagrees with you, OR proves you wrong,
or suggests to try/do something different and you get offended,
you have an ego problem
- Ego and Imposter Sydomre sometimes go hand and hand
- Just focus on yourself
- Dont feed the trolls
- when it comes to imposter syndrome, and you are getting negativity and 
slander, I would suggest to evaluate your environment because its toxic
- 

When starting a new role, how to bootstrap yourself for success
in order to avoid imposter syndrome

- First thing, make sure you congratulate yourself and appreciate the fact
that you got hired and you got job
- So you got hired, and you start monday. What do you do to avoid imposter syndrome?
I would email my manager for a list of the tech the team uses.
I would be honest with myself, in terms of my skills and what the expectations are for me
The reason you need to be honest with yourself, is then you will be honest with the rest of your 
team.
IF you tell your team you know Docker, but then ask 1000 basic questions:
- "what is a docker file" - Red flag, not a good look.
- Or worse, they have to completely re do your attempt at Docker
What you should do instead, is be honest and say ive only heard of Docker ,etc etc
and ask questions, ask for resources blah blah

- Do not set high expectations, and deliver low
- Do not promise false dates, always padd
- Work with your manager to set realistic goals for 30, 60, 90 days
tl;dr
Be honest, and talk with your manager and team
Set yourself up for success
