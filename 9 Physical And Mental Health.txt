Topic:
Physical and Mental Health in programming

- For programmers, how important is stretching?
- How to talk about mental/physical health?
- How can it help prevent/ deal with burnouts


Why do programmers neglect their physical health?
- They never got into it at a young age
- They dont think its important
- They're busy
- The fact that programming is mainly mental work, there
  is no benefit to exercising
- Programmers (stereotypically) are typically introverted and have
  a different set of interests (which do no include gym)
- Lack motivation to exercise because of mental straining work
- Feeling intimidated about going to the gym/starting
    - People judging
    - Muscular chads making fun of a beginner


What are the benefits of going to the gym/exercising as
a programmer?
- It breaks you from your comfort zone
    - Programmers are some of the MOST comfortable people
    - Why?
        - They make a shit ton of money
        - Theyre jobs are pretty easy
        - WFH - permanently
        - insane perks
- It helps to break this comfortable habit and takes you outside
- Teaches you humility - humbles you
- Taking care of your body, has DIRECT impact on your mental health
- The benefits of taking care and exercising, have been proven
  to significantly improve your mental well being
    - your brains takes a 'break' when you exercise
    - When your body feels better, demands more 
      and is pushed, your brain will thrive
    - When your brain does the same thing over and over
      again, it can become stale 
    - introduce a new regime in physical health, your brain
      is re-invigorated 
- It builds confidence *** 
- It can break you out of your shell 
- It can also re-define you

What are some small things every programmer can do RIGHT NOW
to get healthier:
- Drink more water 
    - STOP drinking pop 
    - STOP with the sugar 
    - Drink coffer WITH water
    - STOP drinking juice
- Replace sugar with fruits - NATURAL sugars 
- STOP ORDERING FOOD
    - Get rice, chicken, vegetables
    - Costs money so its expensive
    - its made with so much garbage thats bad for you
    - IT MAKES YOU TOO COMFORTABLE
    - Start cooking
- Think of your body as a vehicle
    - it requires gas and fuel
    - if you give it shit, it will function like shit
    - if you give it premium, well it will function like premium
- Start walking
    - if you have live your whole life without exercise,
      walking is the best way to change your life
    - Walk to the store, walk to where you gotta go
      instead of ubering/driving
- Add one extra hour to sleep
    - Go to sleep TONIGHT one hour earlier
    - Do not look at IG, FB, TikTOk before bed
    - Do not look at IG, FB, TikTOk right when you wake up
- Code less
    - 12 hours of coding != 12 hours of quality work
    - When you code less, you have more time,
      thats when you go to the gym/start exercising
    - Hard stops in programming 
    - Getting quality hours for work stem from different aspects of your life


What about alcohol and drugs?
- Obvious answer - don't do them
- If you can find a healthy balance on these,
  you can be okay
- Do not do the extreme drugs 
    - OK drugs:
        - Caffeine 
        - Weed
        - Natural things that grow from earth
- You need to find moderation
- Dont fall into peer pressure
    - drink/consume what feels safe for you
- Once in a while going out and letting loose is completely fine
- Space out your usage 
- All of these things are made to be enjoyed, but in moderation
- if you THINK you have a problem - reach out and be determined 
  that you CAN fix it


Lack of Motivation in the day
- Everyone has felt the impact of a loooong work day,
and all you want to do is just loaft around after
- You dont want to go to the gym, dont want to cook
- You just want to be lazy, order, and go to sleep
- Motivation needs a goal to be successful
- If you keep just telling yourself you need to lose weight, thats
  a poorly defined goal, it will not motivate you
- You want to lose 20lbs before summer to impress my friends
  who you have been talking to for a while now
- a strong, defined goal will always motivate you
- Think of something/someone that hurt you
- Get motivated through a past painful experience
- Structure your day in a way that fits everything you want
  - we have work
  - we have gym
  - relaxing/chillin
  - cooking/home chores
- Break down your goals into smaller, more manageable check points
- Is reading great motivational books
  - A lot of great books have really good lessons
  - 10X rule
  - The subtle art of not giving a F@#!
- Music is a great motivator
- join/start a class and stick with it
- the lack of motivation, is always the poison of being comfortable
- Being comfortable, after a long day, can do more harm for you
    - you want to break out of that comfort ability
    - Always try to push through, even when you think you cant
- Always take that first step
    - put your gym shoes on
    - Just do any sort of exercise 
    - even if youre there for 20 minutes, lifting light weights
        - its still better than 0 minutes and lifting no weights.
- Break down any goal you have into smaller, achievable pieces
to make sure you are tracking youre own progress and are not
"biting off more than you can chew" with a giant goal


How to get out of a mental 'slump'
- If you have ever felt just depressed, sad,
  you dont want to do anything, you dont care
  about anything
- Example:
    - i was super motivated into creating content
    - i want to stream, make tik toks, make youtube videos
    - I had a good start - everything pointed in the right direction
    - All of a sudden, i stopped stream, didnt make a tik tok,
      and didnt make a youtube video
    - i was/ still am in a a "content creating slump"
    - I lost my motivation and 'want' to do any sort of content
- The best way i first wanted to deal with this is to take time off
- I stopped caring about it for a while - and thats ok
- Only recently ive taken baby steps to start streaming again
- This slump lasted for 4 months 
- You cant force yourself to just 'get better'
- Try your hardest to find the root cause of why you got put
  into this slump in the first place
- Time is the best way to heal
- Talk about your feelings/ talk to whoever or whatever is making you
  feel bad
- A lot of people bottle up, because they get anxious/frustrated when
  expressing their emotions
- Bottling emotion up is never good, because that will manifest into your
   day to day
- Take baby steps into learning how you express your emotion
- Getting your mind off of it 


Feeling intimidated starting to go to the gym/ any form of exercise
- This is a blocker for a lot of people
- A lot of people dont want to start or go to the gym because 
  they feel like they dont belong or that they will be judged
- Example:
    - Lets say you have never exercised a day in your life
      and you go to your local gym
    - You enter, and you see all of these muscular folks
    - You would feel like you completely dont belong at all
- Understand that you are going to the gym for you, not them
- You almost have to not care at all about the opinions of others
  when you are going to the gym
- Non Gym Example:
    - Lets say you have never ran a day in your life
      and you want to start by joining a local running club
    - Right when you all start, you are drastically the slowest
      and right away out of breath
- Think of how much of a D-bag a person needs to be to laugh
  at someone trying to improve their life at the gym
    - You shouldnt even care about the opinions of these types of people
- Don't lose faith - Believe in the process - Believe in the grind
- Let them laugh at you
    - Allow them to laugh, and let it fuel you
    - Stay on YOUR grind, not on their opinion
- If you think you are the 'weakest' or 'unhealthiest' person at the gym,
    - well then you can only go up
- a lot of gyms are not as intimidating as we make them out to be 
- tl;dr - intimidating will happen in any new avenue in life
    - you want to break that and stay on your goals


The impact of work on your mental health and dealing with it
- Work has a significant impact on peoples lives
- Due to that high importance, it has direct impact on our mental well-being
- In my previous stream, we spent 3 hours talking about 
  toxic work environments 
- The damage from a toxic work env. is not worth the T.C
- When it comes to finding a place to work, always remember
    - When you are in the interview process,
    - Its not only them interviewing you,
    - but youre interviewing them
- Be very observant and sure that you are joining a company/team that you
  will actually enjoy
- Let's say after joining, certain things are not working out how you expected them
    - Example: Round of layoffs
    - You unfortunately get laid off
- Getting laid off is a terrible experience, which you totally can take as much time
  as you need to recover and feel better from it.
- This always presents a good moment to mentally take a break
- relax, and just let things happen
- its an opportunity to allow yourself to reset your thoughts and what you want to do
- Try to find the silver lining
- Its okay to be sad when something like this happens, and theres no need to rush into
  getting back into working
