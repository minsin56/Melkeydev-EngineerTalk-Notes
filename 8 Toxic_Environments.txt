Engineering Talks :)
Topic: Toxic Work Environments!

Question Bank:
- The dangers of being passive in a toxic environment
- Starting at a new company and its toxic
- red flags in the interview process
- What are the attributes of a good lead?



How do we define a toxic environment?
- An environment that does not focus on setting you up
for success
- Very little feed back
- Constantly feeling like you are stressed
- Almost no learning and growth opportunities
- Feeling like you are pigeon-holed
- Constantly getting just shitty comments
- Yelled at, being made to feel like youre dumb
- Being scared to ask questions****
- You are getting blamed and the finger is constantly pointed at you
- feeling stagnant

**Do NOT adapt to a bad/toxic environment
- Sometimes, we are in a toxic environment without knowing 
- This causes us to adapt to said environment
- People (JR's especially) will make excuses as to how
their work is not actually toxic - they blame themselves
and pin that its on them and not the other way around
Example:
    - A new JR joins a team - fresh out of school
    - They join a very toxic company
    - No support, strict deadlines, push blame on the junior
    force the JR to work harder or else
    - They continue to work there, adapt to an awful environment
    - Eventually - this could lead to hating your job and hating programming

- You should always have enough confidence in yourself for how you want to be 
treated
- Alot of people are scared to bring up things that bother them to higher-ups
- Focus on YOU and what YOU need
- A good environment will have managers and leads take time to hear your concerns
and NOT blow the mover as "over-reacting"
- Understand the difference between a 'boss' and a 'leader'


Junior vs Senior in a toxic environment
- Junior
    - For a junior, the most important part of the start of your career
    is finding a non-toxic, supportive environment for you to learn, grow
    and big up strong habits that will mold you into the engineer you will
    become.
    - Do not worry about the money right away
        Example:
            - Situation A:
                - 170k Offer
                - You felt it was a bit toxic
                - Told you were not the first option
                - Explicitly told you would be doing only one thing majority of the time
            - Situation B:
                - 130k Offer
                - You felt great - completely vibed with the team
                - They wanted YOU- and want to invest into your growth

    - Some people said they need that extra money
    - Think about the path you will build in the future if you take option A
    - tl;dr Jr should focus on learning, environment and being happy and building confidence

- Senior
    - a toxic environment MAY present opportunity
    * (if it is incredibly toxic, you can leave and not think twice)
    - When you are a senior engineer - you have direct influence of the team,
    on the environment and on junior engineers/future prospects
    - The opportunity lies in changing/improving the toxic environment
    - A senior engineer can make it a non-toxic environment for juniors on the team
    Example:
        - A senior can see a certain workflow/ gaps in a team environment
        - They can then start improving and implementing things to make it better
        - They join and there are no 1:1 managers with their engineers (no bi-weekly/weekly)
        - A senior can start to bring this up OR even start having their own 1:1 with the rest
        of the team,

    - Once you become a senior in your career, and lets say you get a frustrating junior
    - Don't be the senior engineer that is remembered for being a stern ass hole
    - Try to be the senior engineer that is remembered for making a great culture,
    being a great leader - a great teacher

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW MUCH OF A TOXIC ENV. SHOULD YOU TOLERATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Let's say youve been working at a company for 10 months
- And you have realized, that there are aspects of your job that pretty toxic
- Example:
    - Feedback is primarily negative
    - You have an expectation to get something "for the sake of the team"
    - The roadmap is looking a bit dull and stagnant
- But there are some good elements on your team:
    - You like your teammates
    - You like the benefits
    - Remote (if you prefer remote) || great location (if you prefer in person)
    - T.C is much above market average

- If there are some serious concerns, before leaving or thinking of leaving, raise them
to your lead/ manager
- Analyze how they respond to your raised concerned
    - If they brush it off completely, then thats ANOTHER red flag that youre in a 
    serious toxic environment
    - If they hear your concern, and they make an effort to see it from you perspective and
    attempt to make a plan to adress concerns - then thats really good
        - follow up and see if they actually did anything *

- How much should someone tolerate?
- there is no one answer - it depends on you.
    - You should be aware and identify toxic flags
- If you can "see a light in the tunnel" then its worth staying
    - if you raise red flags to management, and they make efforts to change and you
      see/notice the improvements

- If you are in a seriously toxic environment then do not look at your total compensation as 
justification for how you are being treated


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO HANDLE TOXIC CO-WORKERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What is a toxic coworker?
- Being incredibly passive-aggressive
- Being unsupportive of you and questions you have
- Throwing you under the bus for things that dont succeed
- Taking credit for work thats not theres
- not being able to take feedback/criticism 

- These are not leaders, or juniors, these are your 'equals'

- probably the hardest trait to handle in a toxic environment

- TRIPLE C:
    - Cool, Calm, Collected

- If you are having a problem with you teammates; what I would do first:
    - Set a meeting with them

- If the meeting the co-worker went south and there is a continuation of friction,
    - Bring it up to the manger/tech lead and dont be scared to dso so

- Now typically a manager would take the correct action and attempt to resolve this issue
- This could cause some unwanted heat between you and the coworker because
it was raised to a manager
- If the coworker still continues to be worse DUE to you raising it with your manager

- In my opinion: HR should be like, a last LAST resort

- Don't get too attached to work***
- Don't be a business man, be a business, man

------------------------------------------------------------------
Red flags in the interview process
------------------------------------------------------------------
- You are given almost no time to prepare for interview
- They want to hire you almost immediately
- The recruiter/HR person is giving you no information to prepare
- They do not bring up compensation expectations early

- If during your tech interview, the paired engineer is basically giving you
zero feedback on the process, no hints, and just simply pasted the code for you.
- If during the interview they are straight up asking you "why would you do it this way?"
or just giving you straight up blunt, negative answerrs

An ideal interview process takes two to tango
- They are absolutely interviewing you, but you are also interviewing them
    - do you want to work with these people?

- Down the line, the offer is just a complete low ball (border line disrespectful)
    - "based on your skills that you demonstrated we think this is a 'FAIR' offer"
