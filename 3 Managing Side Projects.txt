Is having side projects equally as important as DS and A (LeetCode)
- Yes - 100%
- Youre always going to have some sort of a technical
- S.P = theyre conversation starters
- is they can differentiate you from the rest of the candidates
- allows a convo to be natural and not forced
- S.P because it showcases the company what you really want
- E:X
 - I want to apply to Twitter, as a Data Scientist 
 - Lets say I have done 200 LeetCode questions
 - I make a side project that parses Twitters data 
and creates a dashboard for mods to see

How balance your time for creating side projects:
- A lot of us are busy
- families, full time jobs, other activities, life
- Don't force it - Don't force time in your side project
- Time will come for it
- Start to organise what you spend your time on
 - FT work
 - Activities (gym, hiking, stuff)
 - relaxing (games, stream)
- Create a schedule that works for you to find some time
- The very first thing you should do: Is spend 10 minutes
thinking of what youre going to do
- Writing what you want to work on a piece of paper
- Writing things done, is the first step to any S.P
- It has to come natural, the more you WANT to work on your 
S.P, the more time the universe will create for you
- Sometimes, sacrifice is needed
- if youre going out with your friends to Hibachi every saturday,
maybe miss next saturday and spend that time on your S.P

Should you even do any side projects?
- A lot of us are busy
- A lot of us already have FT jobs
- Some of us are grinding LeetCode
- Some of us have families
- Why should I do any side projects?
 - Learning
 - It's a lot fun
 - You can solve YOUR problems
 - Setting Personal goals (Real users using my product)

How much learning should I incorporate into my side project?
- Two ways to think about this
- Sometimes, you want to incorporate 0* learning
* Theres always gotchas
- If your S.P is a serious investment on your part,
learning new tech may not be appropriate. 
- In these situations, you are more focused on
delivering and creating usable code
- HOWEVER:
- If youre working on something for yourself, its more relaxed,
definitely incorporate a lot of learning, especially if youre busy
- Its a good way to force yourself to learn
- We all use YouTube Tutorials, Udemy courses, medium articles
to learn stuff initially. 
- Doing courses, a lot of the time, youre just copying the work
the instructor is doing
- ^ its hand holding
- A side project forces you to dive in to a new technology
fully by yourself and really learning how to use it 
- To learn, you need to get your hands dirty!


Silver Dollar Syndrome
- We have all done it
- What is it?
 - Youre walking down the street. As youre walking, 
you see a silver dollar on the ground. You get super excited,
so you walk towards it to pick it up. But, before you do, in 
the corner of your eyes, you see another shinier, silver dollar.
So you stop, and then you walk towards the SHINIER silver dollar,
to pick up.
- This is what happens with side projects. You think of an idea,
you get excited, and you start working on it.
But then, you get ANOTHER great side project idea, then you start
working on that one.. repeats.. and repeats..

- Finishing a task, is a skill in itself
- Is always keep your focus on the first goal
- Your brain, sometimes, tricks you and gets bored
- Set goals, and checkpoints for your S.P
- Set an expiration date **
** Sometimes, the love for S.P expires.
- So if you set an expiration date a month ahead,
in a months time, check in yourself.
- See if you still like working on it.
- See if you have been working it
- If you're still passionate about it, renew that expiration date

Do you have to do side projects if you already have a FT job?
- Yes
- Never stop learning
- Never stop trying
- And you never know, your S.P can be the next big thing
and lead you to some form a big goal
- Big Goal:
 - Financial freedom
 - Exposure
- No matter what job you have, no matter where you are in life,
you should always continue pushing your self to learn new things,
try new things and build new things. 


Do side projects == side hustles?
- They can 
- Typically, my advice is dont do a side project where the goal is 
to make money
- S.P === Do it for yourself, for your problems, for learning
- S.H === Do it for money, social clout, etc

- These two have very different goals
- And you need to treat they differently

** A side project, could BECOME a side hustle down the road

Will my full time employer have rights to my project if it moons?
- This question is definitely better suited for a lawyer
- Look at your own contract/ Local laws
- Here is a rule of thumb:
 - Dont work on your side project on company equipment
 - (TRY) not to work on your side project during company hours (9-5)
 - Dont work on your side project on company HQ/Office
 - Try to keep your S.P to yourself...

Do side projects matter for a portfolio
- Yes, of course
- Not all of them
- That each resume, or each application, should be tailored and be specific
- you should also specify which S.P you are going to showcase in your
application package
- If you have a side project that is specific or relatable to a 
company you are applying to, its a great demonstration that you
want to work at that particular company. 
- Side projects are good for starting a conversation
- Side projects are good for differentiating you from other candidates

Do you have to ship/deploy your side project
What is considered a 'finished' side project?

- *refer to Silver Dollar Question above
- Only you know when the side project is really done
- Honestly, a project isnt never really fully finished
- You can never 100% a project
- That's why, in the very beginning or project planning,
set your own goals, set your own milestones and 
create your own checkpoints
- Make sure you are happy with what 'completion'
- Some people may tell you that you need to do X, Y and Z
to be considered 'complete';
- That's up to you to decide
- You don't NEED to deploy it;
- However, I would recommend it. 
- Get others to use your S.P, let them battle test it
let them find bugs, errors, whatever!

Collaboration in side projects (should I and how?)
- This definitely depends.
- When you work with others, i think it adds more seriousness to your S.P
- More people looking the progress, youre held accountable, and obviously
you dont want to drag the team down.
- If you're collaborating, def have a ticket/tracker system

- Its good to collaborate
- HOW to collaborate on a side project:
 - Make sure you're on the same page
as to what this project should do, and the goals for it
- "Too many chefs in the kitchen"
- Make sure everyone has a set responsibility in the project
- You dont want 5 FE Devs and 1 BE Devs
- When more people are involved in a project, they will throw in
new ideas and sometimes it will bloat the project


Git workflow in side projects (best practices)
- When you're working on a local S.P and you use Git to store
the project, sometimes you just do straight to main.
- I think, that any project should follow a bare bone git flow
- I dont think you should push to main on any project
- "Classic meme, branch, review, and merge your own code"
- I believe in this meme
- A bare bone implementation: 
 - have main
 - have development
- Main/Master branch should only be merged into
- tl;dr: Yes, just build good habits even if its for your own S.P

Open source contributions?
- An OS contribution in itself can be a side project
- I believe contributing to side projects is amazing
- If you can create something that helps a community/tool
with your work/code, thats phenomenal
- Open source contributions as side projects are 
probably the best way to start:
 - It gives a SET goal (if merged, and used, youre done)
 - You collaborate with others
 - Your S.P has actual impact and value right away 
 - If your are a junior/just starting and dont have work
experience, open source contributions is a great way
to start building the resume


How to get ideas for a side project??
- Just living your life
- You will encounter a bunch of problems that piss you off
- Solve problems in your life
- Use Reddit/Twitter/Twitch/YouTube
- Talk to people
- Try new things that open your perspective and experiences:
 - Example: I Started Streaming on Twitch.
 it was a new experience, and it opened my perspective.
 From this, I was able to build SnackChat, A Twitch Bot,
 CodePow, etc etc
- Always look at things with a fresh perspective
- Honestly, write down all of your ideas on a piece of paper
